Exercise from the JavaScript Essential Training course from LinkedIn by Morten Rand-Hendriksen.

The code for this repository is based on an exercise from the course.
As usual I like to try different things to make sure I understand the concepts being explained.
At this time I just needed a refresher on JavaScript for a different project.
I did not expand the exercise with some of the suggestions made by the instructor.
